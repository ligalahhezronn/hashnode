### Symmetric encryption

Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that uses the same cryptographic keys for both encryption of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext. Both parties are required to have access to the secret key. This is one of the main drawbacks of symmetric key encryption.

### Asymmetric encryption

Also known as public-key cryptography, is any cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys which may be disseminated widely, and private keys which are known only to the owner.

This accomplishes two functions: authentication, where the public key verifies that the holder of the private key sent the message, and encryption, where only the paired private key holder can decrypt the message encrypted with the public key.

Many protocols rely on asymmetric cryptography, including the transport layer security and the secure socket layer protocols which makes hypertext transfer protocol security possible. The encryption process is also used in browsers that need to establish a secure connection over insecure network like the internet or need to validate a digital signature.
