The layout of a web page can improve user experience and make the content more readable.

The body of a web page can be divided into 3 parts.

1. header - contains introductory information.
    
2. main - there must not be more than one main element in a document.
    
3. footer - contains contact and legal information and links.
    

The header often contains navigation links, a menu and/or a search bar. Brand elements like logos are usually found in the header too.

You can have several footer elements in one document.

&lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; elements are nested inside the &lt;body&gt; container tag.

```xml
<body>
  <header>
    <!--intro information--> 
  </header>
  <main>
     <!--main content--> 
  </main>
  <footer>
     <!--footer information--> 
  </footer>
</body>
```

**Remember:** `<head>` is used to include technical information about the page like title, description, author and keywords. This is not shown to the visitor by the web browser.

## More on Layout

Layouts that improve accessibility and make the content easier to understand for both search engines and users.

1. ### article
    

**&lt;article&gt;** represents an independent, self-contained piece of content.

An article is content that makes sense on its own.

The &lt;article&gt; tag clearly indicates the role for its content. It’s used for content like news stories, and blog posts.

&lt;article&gt; is an example of a semantic tag.

Layout tags like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;footer&gt; and &lt;article&gt; are semantic tags because they give information about what they contain.

2. ### section
    

**&lt;section&gt;** helps to break down the content into parts.

It usually includes a heading.

A web page could be split into separate sections for introduction, contact information.

section is a semantic tag. &lt;section&gt; can be used to separate each chapter, news item, etc.

3. ### aside
    
    **&lt;aside&gt;** is used for secondary, additional or somehow related content.
    

Semantic tags don’t give any visual effect to the content. You can nest layout elements to create organized and accessible pages.
