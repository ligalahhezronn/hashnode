The Web wouldn't be possible without **HyperText. HyperText** is what lets people jump from one page to another, through links.

In this article I'll show you how to connect web pages with **hyperlinks**.

**HyperText** is text that contains a link to another web page.

**Hyperlinks** allows users to

1. move from one web page to another.
    
2. share information across different machines and systems.
    

The **anchor tag** `<a>` is used to create a link on a web page. It is a container tag too. This means that it requires both opening and closing tags.

To create a link, you need `href` to add the destination url.

```xml
<a href="url">whatever text you want to appear in place of the link</a>
```

The url needs to be enclosed in quotes to work without errors. If you forget to add **href** or the quotes, the `<a>` tag won't create a hyperlink.

The url can be placed within a single (') or matching double (") quotes. There is no problem as long as they match.

You can nest hyperlinks inside other text elements.

```xml
<p>Have a look at <a href='https://www.wikipedia.org'>Wikipedia</a></p>
```

The content of an anchor tag `<a>` is the text that you want to display.

You can also use hyperlinks to connect pages of the same website.

The part of the URL that stays the same for all of a website’s pages is the **domain name** (e.g. [microsoft.com](http://sololearn.com)).

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**.

The **hypertext** is because web pages have links.

**Markup** refers to the symbols like &lt;/&gt;.

### Remember 

⭐ You can insert links in pages with the **anchor &lt;a&gt; tag**

⭐ The &lt;a&gt; tag can be **nested** inside text elements

⭐ The destination URL goes with **href**
