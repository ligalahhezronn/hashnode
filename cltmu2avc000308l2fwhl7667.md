With the increasing use of smartphones and digital cameras, people capture a vast number of images daily. However, these images often contain hidden metadata, such as camera settings, GPS coordinates, and timestamps, which can reveal sensitive information and compromise privacy if not handled properly. Additionally, there is a growing demand for tools that allow users to manipulate and manage metadata for various purposes, including privacy protection, data analysis, and content management.

**Project Overview:** The proposed project aims to develop an Image Metadata Extraction and Manipulation Tool using Python and Streamlit. This tool will provide users with a convenient interface to upload images, extract their metadata, visualize location information on Google Maps, manipulate metadata values, and erase metadata if necessary. The tool will be particularly useful for photographers, researchers, and individuals concerned about their privacy.

**Key Features:**

1. **Upload Images:** Users can upload images in common formats such as JPG, JPEG, and PNG.
    
2. **Extract Metadata:** The tool will extract metadata from the uploaded images, including camera settings, GPS coordinates, and timestamps.
    
3. **Visualize Location:** Users can visualize the location information embedded in the image metadata on Google Maps.
    
4. **Manipulate Metadata:** Users can manipulate metadata values, such as editing timestamps or adding custom tags.
    
5. **Erase Metadata:** The tool will allow users to erase metadata from images to protect their privacy or remove sensitive information.
    
6. **Download Cleaned Image:** Users can download the cleaned image after removing metadata.
    

**Technical Implementation:**

* The project will be implemented using Python programming language and Streamlit framework for building the user interface.
    
* Image processing and metadata extraction will be performed using the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and ExifTags module.
    
* Location visualization on Google Maps will be achieved using the Folium library.
    
* Base64 encoding will be utilized for generating download links for cleaned images.
    

**Expected Outcome:** The Image Metadata Extraction and Manipulation Tool will provide users with a user-friendly interface to manage metadata associated with their images. It will empower users to control their privacy by allowing them to erase sensitive information and manipulate metadata as needed. The tool will cater to a wide range of users, including photographers, researchers, and individuals concerned about their digital privacy. Additionally, the project will enhance the developer's skills in Python programming, image processing, and web application development using Streamlit.

**Title: Image Metadata Extractor**

**Introduction:**

**Project Overview:** Our project is developed using Python and Streamlit, a powerful tool for creating interactive web applications. It allows users to upload images, visualize them, extract metadata, display location information on maps, manipulate metadata, and even erase sensitive data from images.

**Key Features:**

1. **Image Upload and Visualization:** Users can easily upload images in common formats such as JPG, JPEG, and PNG. The uploaded image is then visualized for easy inspection.
    
2. **Metadata Extraction:** We employ advanced techniques to extract metadata embedded within the image file. This includes information such as camera settings, creation date, and geolocation data if available.
    
3. **Location Visualization:** If geolocation data is present in the image's metadata, we leverage Folium to dynamically generate a map pinpointing the exact location where the image was captured.
    
4. **Metadata Manipulation:** Users have the power to manipulate metadata directly within our application. They can edit existing metadata fields or even erase sensitive information, ensuring privacy and security.
    
5. **Image Cleaning:** With a simple checkbox, users can opt to erase all metadata from the image, leaving behind a clean version ready for sharing without compromising privacy.
    
6. **Download Option:** To facilitate easy sharing and storage, we provide a download link for the cleaned image, allowing users to save the modified image locally.
    

**Demonstration:** Now, let me walk you through a quick demonstration of our project.

1. *Upload Image*: We start by uploading an image containing metadata.
    
2. *Metadata Extraction*: Our system swiftly extracts metadata from the image, displaying it in a clear and structured format for the user.
    
3. *Location Visualization*: If geolocation data is available, we showcase the image's capture location on an interactive map.
    
4. *Metadata Manipulation*: Users can edit metadata fields as desired, offering flexibility and control over the image's embedded information.
    
5. *Image Cleaning*: With a single click, users can opt to erase all metadata, ensuring privacy and security before sharing the image.
    
6. *Download Option*: Finally, users can conveniently download the cleaned image for further use.
    

Image Metadata Extractor offers a seamless and intuitive solution for exploring, manipulating, and cleaning metadata within images. Whether it's for professional analysis, privacy protection, or simply enhancing user control, our project empowers users to harness the full potential of image data. Thank you for your attention, and I'm open to any questions or feedback you may have.
