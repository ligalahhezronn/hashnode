Links are the essence of the web, connecting one page to the other. They are crucial for navigation, but the default blue underline style doesn't always fit every design.

You can control the color of the links that haven't been visited by the user.

When users interact with a link (also other elements) it changes its **state**. You can refer to the status of an element with **pseudo selectors**.

**a:link** is a pseudo selector that is used to style links that have not been visited.

**a:active** button clicked and mouse not released yet.

By default, all links are underlined.

You can remove the underline style by setting the **text-decoration** property to **none**.
