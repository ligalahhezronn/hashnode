In this article, I want to tell you how you can write a book because I get this question a lot.

I am going to share some tips with you in this article that can help you to actually write your book and finish it.

Take the big task of writing a book and reduce it into smaller, more achievable pieces. All a book really is, is a series of chapters. Writing a chapter is a lot easier than writing a book. And a chapter is just a series of paragraphs. How hard is it to write a paragraph?0

For you to complete the project of writing a book you must have a driving force. For example,

* Why is it important for you to write this book?
    
* Why is it important for your potential readers to get this book?
    

Some say 80% of completion of any project is on the psychology and only 20% is in the mechanics of actually doing the project. To me this simply means that 80% is on **Why** and only 20% is on **How**.

If you can’t write and complete a book, you don’t have enough reasons to write the book.

Do you know what happens when you start to write with enough **“Why”**? You get immersed in it, you get into a flow state where everything flows through you and you get effortless insights and ideas. You have a lot of power, and you get momentum as well, time disappears. Five or ten hours might go by and you are like OMG, you’ve written so much! Being able to access that state is your power to being able to write a book.

Now, there’s a pattern I have discovered from my experience on how I get to this state.

Things that constitute to writing a Good Book

1. Having a ritual that you perform before you get down to write.
    
    This will help you to get prepared psychologically for writing to the peak. Some of the activities that you can do for a ritual includes going for a walk, exercising, meditating.
    
    Performing a ritual helps you eliminate all the noise and enables you to channel your focus into just one thing, writing.
    

  

2. Ask yourself “**WHY**”
    
    Why are you writing?
    
3. Take a break
    
    Whenever you find yourself out of words and just looking at the page, go for a walk. Changing your state is very important.
    
4. Write for the waste bin
    
    Meaning that when you write, you write with the assumption that everything you are writing is going to be dumped in the trash. This assumption releases all the pressure that you put on yourself. Especially if you are a perfectionist.
    
5. Have an outline
    
    Having an outline helps you with the overall project. A book outline guides you on writing the various sections of your book. It is very challenging to write a book without an outline.
