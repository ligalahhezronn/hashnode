**Detecting Deepfake Videos and Images**

### 1\. Introduction

* **Project Overview**:
    
    Project on detecting deepfake videos and images, is aimed at addressing the growing threat of manipulated media in the digital age.
    
* **Motivation**:
    
    The proliferation of deepfake technology poses serious risks, including misinformation, identity theft, and erosion of trust in media.
    
* **Objective**:
    
    The goal is to develop an effective deepfake detection system using machine learning models to safeguard against the harmful effects of fake media.
    

### 2\. Methodology

* **Data Collection**:
    
    Collected diverse dataset of both real and deepfake videos and images from MesoNet: a Compact Facial Video Forgery Detection Network. In IEEE Workshop on Information Forensics and Security, WIFS. Research done in September 2018 at the National Institute of Informatics, Japan.
    
    **Model Architecture**:
    
    Employed state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including Meso4 and MesoInception4, which have shown promising results in deepfake detection.
    
* **Training Procedure**:
    
    The models were trained using the collected dataset with carefully selected hyperparameters, employing mean squared error as the loss function and Adam optimizer for optimization.
    
* **Evaluation Metrics**:
    
    Performance was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the effectiveness of the models.
    

### 3\. Results

* **Performance Evaluation**:
    
    The models demonstrated strong performance on the test dataset, achieving high accuracy rates and robust detection capabilities.
    
* **Confusion Matrix**:
    
    The confusion matrix visualizes the models' performance, showcasing their ability to correctly identify true positives and minimize false positives and false negatives.
    
* **Comparison with Baselines**:
    
    The models outperformed baseline methods, highlighting the effectiveness of this approach in detecting deepfake media.
