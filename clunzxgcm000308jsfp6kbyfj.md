In digital marketing, a landing page is where the visitor "lands" after clicking on a link in an email, an add on google, YouTube, x etc.

Landing pages are designed and written to be clear, concise, and highly persuasive, so people take action.

Landing pages are great for selling stuff; they also let you track customers and collect data.

Landing pages can be invaluable whether you are looking for web developer, data scientist and even marketer.
